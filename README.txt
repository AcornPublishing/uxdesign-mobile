Chapters 2,5,7,8 have asset files in them.

Chapter 10 has no support files as it is a chapter which has sources and references.


Even though most chapters in this book do not need any specific software to follow the
proposed workflows, the prototyping chapters make use of design and prototyping
software to create testable versions of your ideas. It is recommended to have at least
Bohemian Sketch, Tumult Hype, and Framer Studio to get the most from this book.
Additionally, Adobe CC will allow you to make use of some provided assets and test some
ideas.
